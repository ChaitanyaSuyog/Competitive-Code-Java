# Competitive-Code
<b> Hi! </b>
<br><br>
This is a repository which contains my solutions for problems I solve on <a href="https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces.</a> All programs in this repo are written in <b>Java</b>.
<br>
I have clearly mentioned the <code>problem-name</code> in the class name and also the <code>problem-number</code> as a comment.
<br><br>
<p>If you weren't able to solve any of these problems, you can <i><b>debug</b></i> this code to understand the logic.</p>
<br>
<b>P.S - </b> if you have downloaded this repository and are using IntelliJ, make sure to build your project to generate the respective .class files to run the program.
